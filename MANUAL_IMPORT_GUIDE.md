# Manual Import Guide: Spotify to Apple Music

Since Apple Music API requires a paid Apple Developer account ($99/year), this app exports your Spotify playlists in various formats that you can manually import into Apple Music.

## How to Use

1. **Connect Spotify** - Click "Connect Spotify" and authorize the app
2. **Select Playlist** - Click on any playlist you want to transfer
3. **Export** - Choose your preferred export format:
   - **CSV**: Spreadsheet format (good for Excel/Google Sheets)
   - **JSON**: Structured data format
   - **Text**: Simple text list
   - **Copy**: Copy track list to clipboard

## Importing to Apple Music

### Method 1: Manual Search & Add (Recommended)

1. Open Apple Music on your Mac, iPhone, or iPad
2. Create a new playlist with the same name as your Spotify playlist
3. Use the exported track list to search for each song in Apple Music
4. Add found songs to your new playlist

**Tip**: Use the "Copy Track List" button to quickly copy all track names, then paste them into a note app for reference while searching.

### Method 2: Using Apple Music Web Player

1. Go to [music.apple.com](https://music.apple.com)
2. Sign in with your Apple ID
3. Create a new playlist
4. Search for each track from your exported list
5. Add songs to the playlist

### Method 3: Using iTunes (Windows/Mac)

1. Open iTunes
2. Create a new playlist
3. Use the search function to find each track
4. Drag and drop songs into your playlist
5. Sync with your Apple devices

## Tips for Faster Import

- **Start with popular songs**: They're easier to find
- **Search by song name first**: Then narrow down by artist if needed
- **Use partial matches**: Apple Music's search is flexible
- **Check for remixes/versions**: Some songs may have multiple versions
- **Skip unavailable tracks**: Not all Spotify songs are on Apple Music

## Alternative: Free Third-Party Services

- **Soundiiz** (Free tier available) - https://soundiiz.com
- **TuneMyMusic** (Free tier available) - https://www.tunemymusic.com
- **FreeYourMusic** (Paid) - https://freeyourmusic.com

These services handle the transfer automatically but may have limitations on the free tier.
